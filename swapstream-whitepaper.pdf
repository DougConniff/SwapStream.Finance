3.3 SST Staking & Governance
The SwapStream protocol features a dual reward staking system designed to incentivize long-term alignment and participation. Users can stake their SST tokens to earn a share of the protocol's revenue and amplify their governance voting power.

Staking Tiers & Rewards:

Staking rewards are generated from a portion of the protocol's swap fees and are distributed in ETH/WETH, providing a real-yield income stream. Governance power multipliers apply to voting on SwapStream Improvement Proposals (SSIPs).

Lock Duration	Reward Rate (APR)	Governance Power Multiplier
Flexible (No Lock)	5%	1x
30 Days	20%	1.5x
90 Days	35%	2x
180 Days	50%	3x
Key Mechanics:

Rewards: Earned in ETH/WETH from protocol fees.

Early Unstaking: Tokens committed to a lock period cannot be accessed before the lock timer expires. This ensures fairness and guarantees the locked rewards.

Governance: The governance power multiplier applies to the number of votes a user can cast based on their staked amount, giving long-term stakeholders a greater say in the protocol's future.

This system ensures that the most committed community members are rewarded proportionally for their trust and are empowered to guide the SwapStream ecosystem.
